There are 2 folders -- 1) CPU version 2) Softbrain version
For each version, there are 4 workloads in individual folder 

1) CPU version
-To compile and run each workload, go inside each workload folder and do make
-To run, it uses default image sizes. You can specify inputs by looking for usage message
-The targeted kernel is inside the same file as where the main function is called.
-This can be seperated into a different file and has to be reflected in Makefile

2)Softbrain Version
-SB version follows similar organization
-Extra elements are the SB version are the SB related kernel -- $(WORKLOAD_NAME)-sb.c
-You also need to write the DFG for each workload seperately 

If any questions contact, Tony Nowatzki or Vinay Gangadhar

Good luck!!
